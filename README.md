# Extended Reach mod

This simple mod modifies some of the Minecraft's classes (i.e. core modding) to allow players have a much extended reach based on the config value. This mod is designed for **creative mode** usage (i.e. not balanced, and works in survival mode too).

This mod has one dependency. Make sure to install [McLib](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/mchorses-mclib/) mod.
